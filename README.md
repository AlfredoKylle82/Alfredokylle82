Once a self-endowed tic-tac-toe programmer, now a frontend engineer at Kidaken Inc, where I turn ideas into sleek, responsive web apps. My journey started with C# game design, but Iâ€™ve since built and refined my skills in Next.js, React, JavaScript, and API integrations.


ðŸš€ Currently Working On:

 Crafting high-performance front-end solutions in Next.js
 Enhancing app purchase & authentication flows with Django APIs
 Designing interactive prototypes to streamline development cycles

I thrive on problem-solving, design thinking, and continuous learningâ€”because great developers are always evolving. Letâ€™s build something awesome! ðŸš€
