  Once a self-endowed tic-tac-toe programmer, now a frontend engineer at Kidaken Inc, where I turn ideas into sleek, responsive web apps.
  My journey started with C# game design, but I’ve since built and refined my skills in Next.js, React, JavaScript, and API integrations.

🚀 Currently Working On:

 Crafting high-performance front-end solutions in Next.js
 Enhancing app purchase & authentication flows with Django APIs
 Designing interactive prototypes to streamline development cycles

I thrive on problem-solving, design thinking, and continuous learning—because great developers are always evolving. Let’s build something awesome! 🚀
